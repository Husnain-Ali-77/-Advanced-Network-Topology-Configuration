# -Advanced-Network-Topology-Configuration
This repository contains the configuration files, documentation, and resources for a comprehensive network topology project. The goal is to set up a network according to a specified design, involving multiple routers and subnets, while implementing various routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP) and advanced networking techniques like VLSM, NAT, and access control lists (ACLs).

Key Features:
Subnetting with VLSM: Efficient IP address management for various subnets, with specific host requirements.
Routing Protocols Implementation: OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP are configured across different blocks in the network to ensure efficient data routing.
Routing Protocol Redistribution: Integration of different routing protocols using redistribution on multiple routers.
DHCP Configuration: Centralized DHCP servers providing IP addresses to hosts in specified OSPF and RIP areas.
Network Address Translation (NAT): NAT implemented on Router 10 with specific private IP addresses for secure internet access.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Configured ACLs to restrict access to certain servers from specific networks.
